# math-functions
no need of c compiler to run this project.write the function in the command prompt . It will do further steps.
run the exo.exe file. it will ask for any function to enter in terms of t.you can enter the function but you can only use curved brackets to enter the function.

The important thing is how you will enter the function with putting proper brackets and what are the previously defined functions you can use to enter the function.So,you can only use sin ,cos,tan,tani(tan inverse),sini(sin inverse),cosi(cos inverse)and ln(natural logarithum).And also the binomial operators that you can use are +(addition),-(substration),*(multiplication),/(division)and^(to the power of).

now lets discuss about how can you use the bracktes.if you enter like this '3+sin(t)' well you are not gonna get the correct answer atall or you may not even get the answer at all.so, the correct way to write it is '3+(sint)' or '3+(sin(t))'.So, all the pre defined function should be inside a bracket like '(lnt)+1' but if you are only useing that function completly external then no need for example 'ln(t+(sint))', so no need for ln(somthing).and all the binomial oprators should only have two sides to it and enclosed in curved brackets like this '((t+1)^(t-1))/(t^4)' ,so it should always be ((somthing)binomial(somthing)) if that is completly external then no need of brackets for example 3+(2^t).

if you want square root function then make use of power of '^' binomial oprator.for example 't^0.5' which is nothing but square root of t.
So,also I will latter on include more functions like sec,cosec,cot,seci(sec inverse),coseci(cosec inverse)and coti(cot inverse).And also I will include differentiation. I will majourly use chain rule for differentiating functions.

writen in code blocks IDE.

note : will work in any windows computer.but don't seperate the 'dll1.dll' file from 'exo.exe' file.
